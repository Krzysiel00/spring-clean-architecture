### Strict mode :-)

If you are interested to see example of complete separation of domain logic from frameworks (in ex.: Spring Context), you might look at branch: `feature/external-spring-configuration` (See diff here: https://github.com/coi-gov-pl/spring-clean-architecture/compare/feature/external-spring-configuration). That way is advised by Uncle Bob.
